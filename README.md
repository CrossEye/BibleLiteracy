Bible Basics
============

This is for Teddy and Kayleigh.  Mom and I raised you without any religion in your lives.  I don't regret that, except for one thing: you likely never learned many cultural references your peers take for granted.  I suspect that you nonetheless recognized some things: Adam and Eve, Noah's ark.  But there are others that probably fly past you: the Road to Damascus, cutting Samson's hair, David and Bathsheba.  And still others are most likely  familiar, terms you know and vaguely understand without the references: the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son.

Teddy, you and I have talked about this a few times, and I said that I would try to give you a shortened reading list, some Biblical material that's interesting enough to read and not overwhelmingly full of tedium, theology, or proselytizing, enough to give you a feel for the material and fill in some of those cultural gaps.  I've spent a fair bit of time thinking about this, and this is the result.  Of course, it is merely one person's list.  But I think it's a good start.  Teddy, you might want to consult with Sarah for further suggestions.  In this document, I try very hard to maintain a neutral stance, not arguing for or against any particular interpretation of the Bible, nor even making a theism/atheism stand.  Even if I disagree with the text, I present it as straightforwardly as possible.

I also ordered a book that you might want to read, which attempts to gather the most significant Biblical stories into a single place.  I'd like to read it myself, and then you're welcome to borrow it.  *[Biblical Literacy: The Essential Bible Stories Everyone Needs to Know][bl]*.

Note that I am not trying to give the Cliff Notes version of the Bible.  While I hope this gives you some feel for the scope of the Bible, I am much more focused on those parts that will likely come up in everyday interactions.

My list of suggestions is below, but first, an overview of the Bible.




The Bible
---------


### Bible Structure ###

The Bible is divided into *books*.  They vary in length, in style, in content.  Some are full of stories, and feel similar to Greek Mythology collections.  Some give a history of sorts of the Jewish people.  Others are full of rules and admonitions.  Psalms is a collection of poems of praise for God; Proverbs, a collection of teachings   There are books full of prophecy.  The book of Job (rhymes with *lobe*) is entirely the story of the trials and tribulations -- and eventual triumphs -- of a man subject to a bet between God and the devil about whether he'd forsake God if he loses everything he cherishes.  There are the four Gospels, which from various different perspectives describe the life, death, and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, who Christians believe to be the long-prophesied Messiah (aka Christ).  There is a book full of the activities of his disciples after his death.  Many books are letters of advice to early Christian congregatiosn.  The final book, Revelations is an extended prophecy about the end times that a sizable subset of Christians believe is coming.

The books of the Bible are divided into chapters and chapters into verses.  Citations almost always use these.  Verses are short, often single sentences.  Chapters vary a bit more, but they act much like chapters in a novel; convenient places to break.  Chapters and verses are later additions to the text, not in the original sources.  Occassionally there are strange breaks where a complete thought is split across verses or two bits of unrelated content are combined into one.  But mostly they are helpful.

The bible contains over 750,000 words, longer than I novel I've ever read (and I've read War and Peace!)  But for comparison, the five books published in A Song of Ice and Fire so far (aka The Game of Thrones series) has well over twice that.  You've both read the Harry Potter series.  Those combine for more than a million words.  So reading the whole Bible is not impossible, but it's not nearly as easy as reading those works.  Those are simple narratives.  The bible is full of other, less pleasurable sections.  The first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles, for instance, have a combined total of 7,000 words, that all read like this:

> And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth:
> her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon. And when Azubah was dead,
> Caleb took unto him Ephrath, which bare him Hur. And Hur begat Uri, and Uri
> begat Bezaleel. And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the
> father of Gilead, whom he married when he was threescore years old; and she bare
> him Segub. And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of
> Gilead.

So there are parts difficult to read.  And to me, most of these are devoid of interesting content.  If you want a very short synopsis of any of the books, I found a very [useful page][66b] that gives simple, short overviews of each of the books.  It might be worth reading.

Do note that my own list below is not a small amount of reading.  The first book I recommend is Genesis, which at more than 38,000 words, is the length of a long novella.  But altogether, they are a far cry from 750,000!



### Translations ###

There are many dozens, perhaps hundreds, of translations in English alone.

By far the best known is The King James version (aka the Authorized Version).  The language is old and dated, but for many English-speaking Christians, this is the definitive version.  It uses *thee*/*thou*/*thy*, and to a modern ear this might sound like more formal language; don't fall for that.  You've both studied French.  These have fallen out of usage in modern English, but when this translation was made, English still had the equivalent of *tutoiement* (when to use *tu*) and *vouvoiement* (when to use *vous*).  *Thou* and the like were the less formal, more personal words.

When I was still a theist, I was a fan of The Revised Standard version, which was a fairly scholarly version.  The New International Version was meant to be as easy to read as possible; it used to be the version of choice among evangelical Christians.  A more recent version is the World English Bible, which was designed to be a readable, modern version, not subject to copyright problems, and so easy to post on the Web.

You know I've fiddled around with [TiddlyWiki][tw].  One of the projects I've worked on is to have simple online versions of some Bible translations.  It's still a work in progress, but there are four English and two Spanish translations [currently available][twb].  These include the [World English][web] and [King James][kjb] versions.  I would recommend that you choose one of these two translations.  King James is best known, and to many readers, the most poetic.  World English is simply easier to read.  Feel free to read content on my site as you like; they download easily to any device with a web browser.  But there are also printed versions availble in your households.


### The Old Testament ###

The first part of the Bible is Jewish scripture that was written between 1300 BCE and 50 BCE.  This is commonly called the Old Testament, a name which, although ubiquitous may sound insulting to Jewish ears.  This consists of a few unofficial sections:


#### The Law ####

The first five books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deutoronomy, cover the creation story, the initial generations of humanity, the foundation of God's chosen nation of Israel by the descendents of Abraham, their years of exile and slavery in Egypt, their dramatic escape, and their forty years of wandering the wilderness.  It also includes the laws to govern the people, both the general Ten Commandments and many more specific rules.  God grants the descendents of Abraham a land of their own, Israel.  These five books constitute one of the main components of Jewish scripture, called the *Torah*.


#### History ####

These books, from Joshua through Esthe, discuss the the subsequent history of the people of Israel, living first under the rule of the tribes' judges and eventually consolidating under the King Saul.  When he loses favor with God, David becomes King, and his son Solomon after him.  David is a central figure in the Old Testament; he's credited with many of the Psalms and future kings are desribed by their lineage from David, including the New Testament's Jesus.  Others list their *bona fides* as being a "child of David".  Eventually the territory splits into separate states of Israel and Judah, both containing the people of God, descendents of Abraham.


#### Poetry and Wisdom ####

This slightly eclectic group includes Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, already described above, as well as Ecclesiastes, which to my mind has some of the best poetry in the Bible, and The Song of Solomon (aka The Song of Songs), which is a long love poem, with some actual racy bits in it.  Lamentations, which is as sad as it sounds, is sometimes included in this list.


#### The Prophets ####

These books describe a series of preachers/prophets who try to bring the people of Israel and Judah back to following God, with varying degress of success.  The people are often swayed to worship the gods of the neighboring (or conquering) communities, and the prophets have to work hard to convince them to come back.  Sometimes the prophets themselves are not particularly willing.  The books are often divided into Major and Minor Prophets, in part by the lengths of their texts.  The Majors are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekial, and Daniel, and if Lamentations is not included the poetry section, it is included here, attributed to Jeremiah.  The other twelve are the Minors, including the short book of Jonah, which tells of a prophet fleeing from God's exhortation to go to a city and preach, who ends up overboard and in the belly of a whale until he repents and is spit back out, and ends up converting the people of that city.


### The Apocrypha ###

There are a collection of Bible books that in some versions are placed between the Old and New Testaments.  Catholic Bibles tend to include them, and Protestant ones do not.  The Protestants removed them, saying that the original sources of these books were unclear, and that perhaps they were not divinely inspired.  While some of them are interesting in their own right, we will not bother with them here.



### The New Testament ###

Christianity started as an offshoot of Judaism.  The second half of the Bible is the story of the origins of Christianity as well of some of its theology.  Most of these books were written between 50 and 150 years after the death of Jesus.


#### The Gospels ####

The first four books of the New Testament are called the Gospels ("good news").  They tell the story of the ministry of Jesus, a rabbi who wandered around teaching, healing, performing miracles, and preaching an unorthodox theology.  Much of his teaching was in the form of morality tales called parables.  His theology riled up the more orthodox Jews and they in turn riled up the Roman overlords.  Together they tried Jesus for heresy/rebellion, and executed him.  According to these gospels, he rose from the dead on the third day and appeared to many of his disciples.  These four books are not sequential; they are different views on the same events.  Mark is the most raw, with significant narrative issues and a focus on secret knowledge.  Matthew is a more polished version of the same approach, with an emphasis on Jesus as the Jewish Messiah.  Luke is more day-to-day, and focuses more on Jesus as a traditional Rabbi, and as the savior of all people, not just the Jews.  John is much more theological, and focuses on Jesus as being part of God.


#### History ####

The Acts of the Apostles is the story of the first generation of Jesus's followers after his death.  Some were among his twelve disciples; others converted after he was gone.  They wandered around preaching and also performing miracles.  They converted various people, but were also persecuted and often martyred for their faith.  An important story is the conversion of one of their persecutors, a Roman named Saul of Tarsus, later known as Paul, to Christianity.


#### Epistles ####

The Epistles are letters written from various early Christian figures, especially the important people from Acts, to various Christian communities that had been founded by the apostles.  They offer encouragement, theology, and practical advice.  They attempt to settle disputes.  Many of these letters are written by Paul, and the theology he espouses becomes an important part of Christian thought from then on.  These books make up the majority of the New Testament.


#### Prophecy ####

The sole book here is Revelations.  This is a long prophecy about the end-time battle between the forces of God and the forces of the Anti-Christ, as well as the signs the will precede it.
