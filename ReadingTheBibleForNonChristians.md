Bible Basics
============

This is for Teddy and Kayleigh.  Mom and I raised you without any religion in your lives.  I don't regret that, except for one thing: you likely never learned many cultural references your peers take for granted.  I suspect that you nonetheless recognized some things: Adam and Eve, Noah's ark.  But there are others that probably fly past you: the Road to Damascus, cutting Samson's hair, David and Bathsheba.  And still others are most likely  familiar, terms you know and vaguely understand without the references: the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son.

Teddy, you and I have talked about this a few times, and I said that I would try to give you a shortened reading list, some Biblical material that's interesting enough to read and not overwhelmingly full of tedium, theology, or proselytizing, enough to give you a feel for the material and fill in some of those cultural gaps.  I've spent a fair bit of time thinking about this, and this is the result.  Of course, it is merely one person's list.  But I think it's a good start.  Teddy, you might want to consult with Sarah for further suggestions.  In this document, I try very hard to maintain a neutral stance, not arguing for or against any particular interpretation of the Bible, nor even making a theism/atheism stand.

I also ordered a book that you might want to read, which attempts to gather the most significant Biblical stories into a single place.  I'd like to read it myself, and then you're welcome to borrow it.  *[Biblical Literacy: The Essential Bible Stories Everyone Needs to Know][bl]*.

The list is at the bottom, but first, an overview of the Bible.


The Bible
---------

### Bible Structure ###

The Bible is divided into *books*.  They vary in length, in style, in content.  Some are full of stories, and feel similar to Greek Mythology collections.  Some give a history of sorts of the Jewish people.  Others are full of rules and admonitions.  Psalms is a collection of poems of praise for God; Proverbs, a collection of teachings   There are books full of prophecy.  The book of Job (rhymes with *lobe*) is entirely the story of the trials and tribulations -- and eventual triumphs -- of a man subject to a bet between God and the devil about whether he'd forsake God if he loses everything he cherishes.  There are the four Gospels, which from various different perspectives describe the life, death, and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, who Christians believe to be the long-prophesied Messiah (aka Christ).  There is a book full of the activities of his disciples after his death.  Many books are letters of advice to early Christian congregatiosn.  The final book, Revelations is an extended prophecy about the end times that a sizable subset of Christians believe is coming.

The books of the Bible are divided into chapters and chapters into verses.  Citations almost always use these.  Verses are short, often single sentences.  Chapters vary a bit more, but they act much like chapters in a novel; convenient places to break.  Chapters and verses are later additions to the text, not in the original sources.  Occassionally there are strange breaks where a complete thought is split across verses or two bits of unrelated content are combined into one.  But mostly they are helpful.

The bible contains over 750,000 words, longer than I novel I've ever read (and I've read War and Peace!)  But for comparison, the five books published in A Song of Ice and Fire so far (aka The Game of Thrones series) has well over twice that.  You've both read the Harry Potter series.  Those combine for more than a million words.  So reading the whole Bible is not impossible, but it's not nearly as easy as reading those works.  Those are simple narratives.  The bible is full of other, less pleasurable sections.  The first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles, for instance, have a combined total of 7,000 words, that all read like this:

> And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth:
> her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon. And when Azubah was dead,
> Caleb took unto him Ephrath, which bare him Hur. And Hur begat Uri, and Uri
> begat Bezaleel. And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the
> father of Gilead, whom he married when he was threescore years old; and she bare
> him Segub. And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of
> Gilead.

So there are parts difficult to read.  And to me, most of these are devoid of interesting content.

### Translations ###

There are likely hundreds of translations in English alone.

By far the best known is The King James version (aka the Authorized Version).  The language is old and dated, but for many English-speaking Christians, this is the definitive version.  It uses *thee*/*thou*/*thy*, and to a modern ear this might sound like more formal language; don't fall for that.  You've both studied French.  These have fallen out of usage in modern English, but when this translation was made, English still had the equivalent of *tutoiement* (when to use *tu*) and *vouvoiement* (when to use *vous*).  *Thou* and the like were the less formal, more personal words.

When I was still a theist, I was a fan of The Revised Standard version, which was a fairly scholarly version.  The New International Version was meant to be as easy to read as possible.  A more recent version is the World English Bible, which was designed to be a readable, modern version, not subject to copyright problems, and so easy to post on the Web.

You know I've fiddled around with [TiddlyWiki][tw].  One of the projects I've worked on is to have simple online versions of some Bible translations.  It's still a work in progress, but there are four English and two Spanish translations [currently available][twb].  These include the [World English][web] and [King James][kjb] versions.  Feel free to read content on there as you like.  But there are also printed versions availble in your households.


### The Books ###

I found a very [useful page][66b] that gives simple, short overviews of each of the books.  It might be worth reading.

The first part of the Bible is Jewish scripture that was written between 1300 BCE and 50 BCE.  This is commonly called the Old Testament, a name which, although ubiquitous may sound insulting to Jewish ears.  This consists of a few unofficial sections:

#### The Law ####

The first five books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deutoronomy.  These cover the creation story, the initial generations of humanity, the foundation of God's chosen nation of Israel by the descendents of Abraham, their years of exile and slavery in Egypt, their dramatic escape, the laws to govern these people


The List
--------

* **Genesis**
* **Exodus**
* Parts of the stories of Saul, David, and Solomon, but what parts?
* The story of Elijah, or parts thereof
* **Judges 13-16** (Samson)
* 10 - 15 Psalms, but which ones?
* Some portion of Ecclesiastes
* **Matthew** or **Luke** (I have a soft spot for the more raw **Mark**, myself, but the others are probably better intros.  And definitely not **John**.)
* **Acts**
* 6 - 8 Epistles, but which ones?
